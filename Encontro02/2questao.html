    <h1>Programming language</h1>
    <p>A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various 
    kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
    <p>Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that 
    use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the 
    invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 
    9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age. Since the early 1800s, programs 
    have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The 
    programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response 
    to different inputs or conditions.</p>
    <p>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many 
    programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while 
    other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</p>
    <p>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and 
    semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming 
    language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation 
    that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and 
    extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>

    <h1>Scripting languages</h1>
    <p>A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates
    the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting 
    languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled).</p>
    <p>Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be combined into 
    more programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages 
    within a web browser, usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous 
    games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the 
    case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also 
    sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of 
    abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.</p>
